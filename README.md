### CICD
# Continuous Integration (CI)
![diagram](continuous_integration.png?raw=true "Continuous Integration")
  - developers merge code to main branch multiple times a day and there is an automated build and test process which gives instant feedback
    - faster software builds
    - customer satisfaction by deploying on time
    - small code changes make fault isolation simpler and quicker
# Continuous Delivery (CD)
![diagram](continuousDelivery.png?raw=true "Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery")
  - CD extends CI by automating the release process so we can deploy our applications at any point of time with the click of a button

# Continuous Deployment (CDE)
![diagram](continuousDeployment.png?raw=true "Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment")
  - With CDE we go one step further than continuous delivery by deploying to our customers after every development change, fully automated without even clicking a button

# Difference between CD & CDE
  - In continuous delivery the deployment is done manually and in continuous deployment it happens automatically.

# Jenkins and the benefits of using it
